#Update
  Changed key binding so it did not interfere with opening the side panel.

# BeautifyRuby

Beautifies Ruby code. This plugin uses the [Ruby Script Beautifier](http://www.arachnoid.com/ruby/rubyBeautifier.html) written by P.Lotus

I made very little modification to get it to work with a Sublime Text 2 plugin.

### Key Binding

Mac OSX

```
  ctrl + cmd + k
```
Linux

```
  ctrl + alt + f
```
